## Some Notes 📝

N-layered monolith structure preferred at the backend service. For the frontend part, I created an SPA that communicates with the backend via fetch function. 
Ehcache is being used for caching news for every user and weather conditions for every city. Durations are 3 and 1 hours respectively. 
Dark Mode preference and last used tags for plans are being held in localStorage.
